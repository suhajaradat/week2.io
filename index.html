		<h2> make your bed</h2> 
	<p>
 making your bed is technically a chore, but it can also be a deceptively simple and tiny way to make yourself feel good. The reasons are manifold: It goes a long way in making your space (and mind) less cluttered, it encourages good sleep hygiene (who doesn’t want to crawl into a freshly made bed at the end of the day?), and it might also do some surprising psychological work behind the scenes too.
In an oft-repeated quote, retired Navy admiral William H. McRaven once said, “If you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride, and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another. And by the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed.”
I never used to be the type of person who made her bed every day, but after stumbling across this tip in my mental health reporting, I decided to give it a try. At first, it was simply…nice. With a made bed, I found it easier to keep the rest of my room clean, which is always good for my mental health. I didn’t realize just how much the practice grounded me and served as a guidepost for other good habits until I stopped. After a few weeks of feeling more scattered and depressed than usual, I realized, Shit, I haven’t been making my bed. Turns out, it made all the difference.

		<h2> Put off checking your phone</h2>
	<p> Every time we check our phones—especially after a long stretch of time away, like when we’re sleeping—we invite a flood of stimulation and bullshit into our brain space. For such a tiny device, your phone holds a lot of potential stressors, like news notifications, your bank-account balance, and texts that demand your attention right now. And for many of us, once we check our phones, we’re pretty much plugged in for the rest of the day. Why not delay that just a little bit?
“When you wake up, you’ve been sleeping and you’re in a comparatively relaxed state,” says Howes. “Wouldn’t it be great to maintain that general level of calm as long as you can? It’s better for our bodies and our reactive emotional systems to reduce how long we’re feeling stress in a day.”
Plus, reaching for your phone first thing is a quick way to derail your whole morning routine. Who hasn’t lost themselves down a Twitter hole before even getting out of bed?

	<h2> Stretch your body</h2>
	<p>
 I didn’t want to put exercise on this list because I’m a firm believer that you’re either a morning workout person or you’re not, and no listicle on SELF is going to convince you to add exercise to your morning routine if you don’t want to.
But—but—anyone can enjoy a good stretch in the morning. It doesn’t have to be a full-on yoga routine or even have the purpose of supplementing your regular workout. It can just be a way to get your blood flowing and, TBH, to tap into the nice feeling of a good streeetch. Of course, stretching properly to avoid injury is extra important, especially in the a.m., when you might be stiff and not properly warmed up. This full-body stretch is a good place to start.
